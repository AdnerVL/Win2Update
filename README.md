Before using this script, please be aware of these security considerations:

- Review all scripts before execution in your environment
- Implement proper file and folder permissions
- Configure logging to a secure location
- Verify script integrity before each run
- Monitor update sources and network traffic
- Consider implementing hash verification
- Use environment-specific paths

## üìã Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Internet connection
- Administrator privileges
- Windows Package Manager (`winget`)
- PowerShell modules: `PSWindowsUpdate`, `powershell-yaml` (auto-installed if missing)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files:

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/AdnerVL/Win2Update.git
   ```

2. Create and configure a secure location for the scripts:

   ```powershell
   # Example: Create directory and set permissions
   $scriptPath = "$env:ProgramFiles\WindowsUpdate"
   New-Item -Path $scriptPath -ItemType Directory -Force
   ```

3. Copy the files to your secure location and configure:
   - Move the downloaded files to your chosen location
   - Set NTFS permissions according to your security policy
   - Update configuration in the scripts
   - Test in a non-production environment first


## üì¶ Components

- `RemoteW2Update.ps1`: Main PowerShell script for remote, multi-host Windows and app updates. Handles queueing, error logging, and can retry unreachable hosts. Uses PsExec for all remote execution (no WinRM/PSRemoting required).
- `RemoteW2Update_Improved.ps1`: Improved version of the remote script with enhanced error handling, optional parallelism for multiple hosts, structured JSON logging, and configurability (including winget hash verification).
- `AdvancedRemoteUpdate.ps1`: Advanced remote update script with built-in YAML-based tracking (hosts_tracking.yaml) to skip hosts updated within a configurable period (default 5 days). Performs Windows Updates, winget upgrades, firmware/driver updates via MSUpdate, and optional auto-reboot. Uses PsExec for remote execution (no WinRM/PSRemoting required), includes queue management with 3-hour retry for failures/unreachable hosts, connectivity checks, structured JSON logging (.logs directory), and handles timeouts up to 15 minutes per host. Implements own YAML parser without external module dependency.
- `UpdateScriptv1.ps1`: Standalone PowerShell script for local Windows and app updates, with logging, admin check, and optional auto-reboot.
- `RunRemoteW2Update.bat`: Batch file to launch `RemoteW2Update.ps1` with correct PowerShell policy.
- `RunUpdateScript.bat`: Batch file for launching `UpdateScriptv1.ps1` with elevation and debug logging.
- `hosts.txt`: List of target hostnames/IPs for remote updates (used by `RemoteW2Update.ps1`).
- `hostQueue.txt`: Tracks hosts that failed or are queued for retry (auto-managed, ignored by git).
- `errorLog.txt`: Error log for remote update failures (auto-managed, ignored by git).
- `Logs/`: Contains update and console logs for local/remote scripts (e.g., via UpdateScriptv1.ps1 or RemoteW2Update.ps1).
- `.logs/`: Auto-created directory for structured JSON logs from AdvancedRemoteUpdate.ps1.
- `.gitignore`: Excludes `.exe`, `.txt`, log, and queue files from version control.
- `Use.txt`: Security and usage best practices.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.


## üö¶ Usage

### Local (Single Machine) Update
1. **Run as Administrator:**
   - Right-click `RunUpdateScript.bat` and select "Run as administrator"
   - Or run from PowerShell (Admin):
     ```powershell
     & ".\RunUpdateScript.bat"
     ```
2. **What it does:**
   - Checks for admin rights and elevates if needed
   - Runs `UpdateScriptv1.ps1` to update Windows and apps using winget
   - Handles logging and optional auto-reboot


### Remote (Multi-Host) Update
1. **Prepare `hosts.txt`:**
   - List all target hostnames or IPs, one per line
2. **Run as Administrator:**
   - Right-click `RunRemoteW2Update.bat` and select "Run as administrator"
   - Or run from PowerShell (Admin):
     ```powershell
     & ".\RunRemoteW2Update.bat"
     ```
3. **What it does:**
   - Reads `hosts.txt` for targets
   - Queues unreachable hosts in `hostQueue.txt` for retry (auto-managed)
   - Uses PsExec to run all update and upgrade steps on each remote host with full admin rights (no WinRM/PSRemoting required)
   - Logs errors to `errorLog.txt` and all update activity in `Logs/`

### Advanced Remote (Multi-Host) Update with Tracking
1. **Prepare `hosts.txt` or configuration:**
   - List all target hostnames or IPs, one per line in `hosts.txt`
   - Optional: Configure `hosts_tracking.yaml` for per-host settings (auto-created if missing)
2. **Run as Administrator:**
   - Right-click `RunAdvancedUpdate.bat` and select "Run as administrator"
   - Or run from PowerShell (Admin):
     ```powershell
     & ".\RunAdvancedUpdate.bat"
     ```
3. **Example Commands:**
   - Run with default settings (5-day skip, auto-reboot off, 3-hour retry):
     ```powershell
     .\AdvancedRemoteUpdate.ps1
     ```
   - Force retry all queued hosts and enable auto-reboot:
     ```powershell
     .\AdvancedRemoteUpdate.ps1 -ForceRetry -AutoReboot -Debug
     ```
   - Skip queue completely and change skip days to 7:
     ```powershell
     .\AdvancedRemoteUpdate.ps1 -SkipQueue -SkipDays 7
     ```
   - Specify custom files and retry after 30 minutes:
     ```powershell
     .\AdvancedRemoteUpdate.ps1 -QueueDuration 1800 -HostsFile "myhosts.txt" -YamlFile "custom.yaml"
     ```
4. **What it does:**
   - Tracks update status in a YAML file (.logs directory for structured logs) to skip hosts updated within configurable days (default 5)
   - Performs Windows Updates (including firmware/drivers via MSUpdate), winget upgrades, and optional auto-reboot
   - Queues unreachable/failed hosts for retry (default 3 hours, configurable)
   - Uses JSON-structured logging for successes and errors (no external YAML module required; built-in parser)

### Logging and Error Handling
- Log files are created in the `Logs` directory for each run
- Remote errors are logged in `errorLog.txt`
- Hosts that fail or are unreachable are queued in `hostQueue.txt` for later retry
- All `.txt` and `.exe` files, logs, and queue files are excluded from git by `.gitignore`


## üõ† Logging and Troubleshooting

- **Log Files:**
  - Logs are stored in the `Logs` directory.
  - Example log files:
    - `UpdateLog_<timestamp>.txt`
    - `UpdateLog_<timestamp>.txt.winget`
    - `UpdateLog_Console_<timestamp>.txt`
  - Remote error log: `errorLog.txt`
  - Host queue for retry: `hostQueue.txt`
  - No WinRM/PSRemoting configuration is required or performed

- **Troubleshooting:**
  - Check log files for errors and warnings.
  - Ensure proper permissions on the `Logs` directory.
  - Verify internet connectivity for updates.
  - Use `-Verbose` flag for detailed output.
  - For remote updates, check `errorLog.txt` and `hostQueue.txt` for issues and retry status.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

- Always backup important data before running system updates
- Use approved network connections only
- Implement script signing for production use
- Monitor update processes for anomalies
- Review logs for security events
- Use HTTPS for any network operations
- Keep scripts in access-controlled locations
- Implement audit logging where possible
- Consider using PAM solutions for privileged operations
- Corporate environments should implement additional security controls

### Access Controls
1. Script directory: Admins (Full), System (Full)
2. Log directory: Service Account (Write), Admins (Full)
3. Temp directory: Service Account (Full), cleaned after execution

### Performance & Security
- Implement log rotation
- Monitor disk space
- Clean temporary files
- Review access logs
- Validate update sources
- Ensure PsExec is available and allowed by endpoint security
- Use approved proxy settings where applicable
