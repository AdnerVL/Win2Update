# Windows Update Script Usage Guide

## Security Considerations

### Environment Setup
- Use organization-approved script locations only
- Implement NTFS permissions on script directories
- Configure audit logging for script access
- Use separate service accounts where appropriate
- Implement script signing for production

### Path Security
- Default paths should be configured per environment
- Example paths (DO NOT use these directly):
  - Scripts: %ProgramFiles%\YourCompany\UpdateTools
  - Logs: %ProgramData%\YourCompany\Logs\Updates
  - Temp: %SystemRoot%\Temp\Updates

### Access Controls
1. Script directory: Admins (Full), System (Full)
2. Log directory: Service Account (Write), Admins (Full)
3. Temp directory: Service Account (Full), cleaned after execution

## Technical Implementation

### Script Components
- Main batch script (administrator execution required)
- Generated PowerShell script (temporary, secured location)
- Log files (secured with proper ACLs)

### Core Functionality
1. Security validation and integrity checks
2. Privilege management and elevation
3. Secure module installation and verification
4. Update execution in isolated context
5. Secure logging and cleanup

### Security Features
- Automated privilege handling
- Temporary execution policy modification
- Secure module installation
- Protected file operations
- Audit logging capability

## Best Practices

### Secure Installation
1. Use approved deployment methods
2. Verify file integrity after deployment
3. Configure environment-specific paths
4. Test in isolated environment first

### Regular Usage
1. Run during approved maintenance windows
2. Monitor for security events
3. Review logs for anomalies
4. Use approved network paths only

### Corporate Environment
1. Implement change control procedures
2. Use approved proxy settings
3. Follow security baselines
4. Document all customizations
5. Maintain update blacklist/whitelist

### Performance & Security
- Implement log rotation
- Monitor disk space
- Clean temporary files
- Review access logs
- Validate update sources

## Support Requirements
- Windows 10/11 with latest security updates
- PowerShell 5.1+ with security modules
- Administrative access through PAM
- Controlled internet access
- Approved winget configuration
