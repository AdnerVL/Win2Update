**Functionality**:
- Creates `UpdateScript.ps1` with the provided PowerShell code.
- Runs the script with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` to avoid policy restrictions.
- Deletes the PowerShell script after execution to clean up.

**Advice**:
- Save the batch file as `RunUpdateScript.bat` and run it by double-clicking or via command prompt.
- If UAC is enabled, a prompt may appear for elevation; this is unavoidable.
- Ensure `C:\Tools` exists or modify `$logPath` to a valid directory.
- Test the batch file in a non-admin context to verify elevation.
- For repeated use, consider keeping `UpdateScript.ps1` instead of deleting it to avoid recreation overhead.
